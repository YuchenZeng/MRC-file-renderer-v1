# MRC-File-Renderer

This program takes a MRC file, parses it, converts the MRC data to a volume and renders the volume slices. Please not that you can file in Firefox, Safari without any issue. But, you need to turn on a web server if you want to run it on Google Chrome.

This is written with Three.js and HTML. It will be updated to run with AngularJS in the near future.

**`Use this in the following ways:`**

**1.** You can download this repo and run the **index.html** file in the main folder to see the full functionality of the MRC file loader.

**2.** Also, you can change your model by 
    1. Include the .mrc in the models/mrc/bin8Data/ folder 
    2. Replace the file name in the HTML file.
