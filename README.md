# MRC-File-Renderer

This program takes a MRC file, parses it, converts the MRC data to a volume and renders the volume slices. Please not that you can file in Firefox, Safari without any issue. But, you need to turn on a web server if you want to run it on Google Chrome.

This is written with Three.js and HTML. It will be updated to run with AngularJS in the near future.

    1. Include the .mrc in the models/mrc/bin8Data/ folder 
    2. Replace the file name in the HTML file.
